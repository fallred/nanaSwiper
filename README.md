# Nana's Swiper

It's a slider that only supports horizonal slide. Just for nowï¼ŒI'll develop vertical slide in the next version.

The reason why develop such a swiper,just because a project need sliders with sprit and react. And it's hard to find a 3rd plugin which support for slider,react and canvas. It's easy to find a lot of plugins that support canvas and react or react and slider. That's why I develop such a plugin.
